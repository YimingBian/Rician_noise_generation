The function "Rician_noise(gray_img, M)" takes two inputs:
1) gray_img is a 2-D matrix. You may convert the RGB image to gray image by rgb2gray()
2) M is called measured pixel intensity. It is a concept in signal noise ratio (SNR). More explanation can be found in [1], which is available at "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2254141/"
